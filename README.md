## General Information
Here are some of my creativity sparks, which you can watch as I gathered them in one application.
Despite name suggesting sort of longer animations with rewinding functions or something like that, I would rather call them loaders, since most of them don't take longer than 5 seconds.
My first idea of this project was to name it as I did, so I just sticked with this title to the end.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6


## Features
#### List of the ready features:
- The application allows you to Play, Stop and go Previous/Next animation,
- Page consists of 8 blocks with 6 animations per block,
- Each block is displaying current animation's number and total number of animations in the bottom right corner,
- Application will adjust its size and blocks placement, depending on the user's screen resolution.

#### Additional info:
- There is 1 hidden Easter Egg.


## Setup
To run application, visit [_this_](https://piotress5.github.io/animations/) website or download all files and execute index.html in your browser (make sure to include all required files within one catalog).


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
Only things I'm thinking of is maybe to make webpage more "dynamic" with some fluidish transitions or similar effects.

Room for improvement:
- No plans for now.

To do:
- Adding next blocks/animations.
